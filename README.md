#Intro
Ember-Youtube is a simple tiny component (controller/view/template) that can be dropped into an existing ember application to enable
the application to fully drive a chromeless youtube player via javascript.  

#Install
Simply clone this repo and grab YoutubeController.js YoutubeView.js and youtube.handlebars from public/.  In the near future, I will have a 
build-step that will output this as a tiny library for inclusion as javascript.

#Live Demo
